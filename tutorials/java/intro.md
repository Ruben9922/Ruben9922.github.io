Welcome to my Java tutorial! It will consist of a series of posts introducing you to programming in the Java programming language. I'm assuming you're a complete beginner to programming.

I'll dive straight in and won't spend ages trying to convince you why Java is good or whatever. I'll also try to keep each part as succinct as possible so you can learn quickly.

Hope you enjoy! :smiley:
