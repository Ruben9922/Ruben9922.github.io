I enjoy programming, mainly in **Java** and **C#**, but [have experience in other languages](/about/skills/#languages).

Recently I've been learning about web development in **React** and game development in **LibGDX**. I've also learnt about the new Java 8 features such as lambda expressions, [streams](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html) and concurrency using [CompletableFuture](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html).

I also like listening to house music and have been learning how to produce music and DJ.
