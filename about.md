My main interests are in computers and music, though I also have other hobbies.

<h2 class="ui header">Computing</h2>
I enjoy coding in different types of projects, mainly desktop and web applications. My experience includes:

* Various desktop applications mainly in C# and Java, initially to teach myself programming
* Applications published on Google Play and Windows Store
* Simple web pages using PHP to teach myself web development and server-side scripting
* Client-side web apps built using React, ES6 and Semantic UI or Bootstrap 3
* To-do list and bill splitter web applications using PHP, jQuery and SQLite as part of a university module
* Various other pieces of coursework for university
* Booking system for a local hair salon for A-level project
* Experience with DBMSs like MySQL, SQLite, Oracle Database and MongoDB

Recently I've been learning about web development in **React** and game development in **LibGDX**. I've also learnt about the new Java 8 features such as lambda expressions, [streams](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html) and concurrency using [CompletableFuture](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html).

<h2 class="ui header">Music</h2>
I love listening to house music, though I appreciate other kinds of music. Currently I'm mainly into future and deep house, as well as just "house". I've also been learning how to produce electronic music and DJ.
