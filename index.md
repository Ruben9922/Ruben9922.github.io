## Programming
In my spare time I enjoy programming different types of applications in various languages
* Gradually taught myself **C#** initially by making [simple forms-based applications](http://ruebzkuebz.ruben9922.co.uk/programs/myprograms) after following a tutorial in a computing magazine
* Learnt **Python** using my Raspberry Pi at one point
* Learnt **Java** when making Android apps and on my course
* Still enjoy programming and learning about **more advanced features like lambda expressions** in Java and C#
* Have a lot of experience in **building UIs** with **WPF** and **Windows Forms** in C# and **JavaFX** in Java
* Used **Processing** for drawing in 2D/3D and started learning **Unity** for making games
* Used **other languages** such as **C** and **Haskell**

## Store Apps
* Made a **fast click game** called *Super Click* originally for [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/super-click/9wzdncrfjtrq) but later recreated for [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ruben9922.superclick)
* Made a [**Binary Converter app**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ruben9922.binaryconverter) for Google Play Store, which converts between two numeral systems (any between base 2 and 36) and even allows for signed numbers in two's complement

## Web Development
* Initially just learnt how to make **static web pages** using simple **HTML** and **CSS**
* Started doing **server-side scripting** with **PHP** to make dynamic web pages, but didn't look into client-side scripting for ages
* Later used **JavaScript** with **jQuery** to put application logic on the client side and create more responsive UIs
* Used **Bootstrap** to build nice UIs
* Now **interested in more modern web technologies** and **enjoy using JavaScript** so started using **Meteor**, a full-stack JavaScript framework
* Interested in **NoSQL** database management systems so have used **MongoDB**
* Also had some experience with **Spring**, **JHipster** and **AngularJS 1.X**
* Currently learning **Angular 2**

## Electronic Music
* [Love listening to house music](https://www.last.fm/user/ruben_rjd), particularly deep house and future house currently, though I appreciate all kinds of music
* Interested in producing electronic music and [experiment with creating songs](https://soundcloud.com/ruben-dougall)
* Learnt to DJ mainly by teaching myself on my DJ controller
