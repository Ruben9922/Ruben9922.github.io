# Programming
In my spare time I enjoy programming different types of applications in various languages
* Gradually taught myself C# by making [simple forms-based applications](http://ruebzkuebz.ruben9922.co.uk/programs/myprograms) after following a tutorial in a computing magazine
* Learnt Python using my Raspberry Pi at one point
* Learnt Java when making Android apps and on my course
* Still enjoy programming and learning about more advanced features like lambda expressions in Java and C#
* Have a lot of experience in building UIs with WPF and Windows Forms in C# and JavaFX in Java
* Used Processing for drawing in 2D/3D and started learning Unity for making games
* Used other languages such as C and Haskell

# Store Apps
* Made a fast click game called *Super Click* originally for [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/super-click/9wzdncrfjtrq) but later recreated for [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ruben9922.superclick)
* Made a [Binary Converter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ruben9922.binaryconverter) for Google Play Store, which converts between two numeral systems (any between base 2 and 36) and even allows for signed numbers (in two's complement)

# Web Development
* Initially learnt how to make static web pages using simple HTML and CSS
* Used PHP with MySQL and SQLite
* Used JavaScript with jQuery
* Now interested in modern web technologies and NoSQL so started using Meteor full-stack JavaScript framework
* Also had some experience with Spring, JHipster and AngularJS 1.X
