    <Header as="h1">About</Header>
    <p>I am a Computer Science student at the University of Warwick, currently about to start my fourth year.</p>

    <p>I have strong software development skills and experience with a number of languages, frameworks and tools. I have worked on numerous personal software projects in my spare time. Currently these include 3D games in Unity and front-end web apps with React, but previously these have included web applications with Meteor and PHP, desktop applications in Java and C#, and drawings in Processing. For my third-year project at university I developed an educational tool for finite automata. I have also completed various pieces of coursework for university, the most recent of which include implementing several digital forensics techniques in MATLAB, producing a 3D version of Snake in C++ and solving problems with big data using Hadoop.</p>

    <p>Outside of computing, I love listening to and producing house music. At the moment I like house, deep house and tech house. I also taught myself the basics of DJing.</p>
